#+TITLE: Cookiecutter CI CWI

A Cookiecutter template for starting your Python projects at CI CWI.

This template lets you easily set up a Python package for your own projects.
It automatically creates a directory tree with sensible locations for your
code, documentation and tests, and directly makes a number of useful tools
available to more conveniently install, document and eventually publish your
project.
